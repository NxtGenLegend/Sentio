**Supported Input Types:**

- Select dropdowns with options
- Checkboxes with proper styling
- Textareas for longer content

**Behavior:**
- In view mode: displays static values with labels
- In edit mode: renders appropriate input fields with onChange handlers
- Automatically manages the `editedClient` state

### 4. **Save & Cancel Functionality**

**Save Changes:**
```javascript
const handleSave = async () => {
  // Updates client in Supabase
  await supabase.from('clients').update(editedClient).eq('id', editedClient.id)

  // Updates local state
  setClients(updatedClients)
  setSelectedClient(data)
  setIsEditing(false)
}
```

**Cancel:**
- Reverts all changes back to original values
- Exits edit mode without saving

### 5. **State Management**
- `isEditing` - tracks whether edit mode is active
- `editedClient` - holds temporary edited values
- `useEffect` - syncs editedClient with selectedClient when client changes
- All edits are stored locally until "Save Changes" is clicked

## Code Location

All changes in: `/mnt/c/Users/skjet/Coding/Sentio/src/App.jsx`

**Lines 2102-2531** - ClientDetailPage component with full edit functionality

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the Clients page
2. Click on any client row
3. On the client detail page, click "Edit Profile" button
4. All fields become editable with appropriate input types
5. Make changes to any fields
6. Click "Save Changes" to commit to database
7. Or click "Cancel" to discard changes

## Security & Data Handling

- **SSN Masking**: In view mode, only shows last 4 digits (***-**-1234)
- **Conditional Fields**: Non-US citizen fields and employment fields show/hide based on selections
- **Database Updates**: Uses Supabase's `.update()` method with proper error handling
- **State Synchronization**: Local state updates immediately after successful save

## Next Steps

As requested by the user, still need to:

1. **Update CreateProspectModal** - Add all comprehensive client fields to prospect creation form
2. **Make prospect details editable** - Implement similar edit functionality for ProspectsPage
3. **Update prospects schema** - Add comprehensive client fields to prospects table structure

3. Click on Richard Ashford, Margaret Whitmore, or Harrison Blackwell
4. Click "Edit Profile"
