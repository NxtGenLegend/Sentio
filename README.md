Problem & Solution: Financial advisors for ultra-high-net-worth clients struggle with overwhelming manual data logging and client upkeep. Our solution is an onboarding & bookkeeping platform that automates new client information and scrapes the internet to know the clients needs before they do.
AI: AI was utilized to scrape the web for relevant news about the client's industry and automatically send an email to their wealth manager if a noticable shift is detected.
